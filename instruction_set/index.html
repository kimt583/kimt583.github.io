          <p>When we first visited Metropolitan Museum of Art, various people were sitting on the stair and there were lots of pedestrians. Our targets were people who visit the MET. We set the location at the right side of the MET next to the fountain. An installation was set to make people draw or write something and observed with 3 different condition.

            <h3>
              Metropolitan Museum of art
            </h3>

            <p>The Met Fifth Avenue presents over 5,000 years of art spanning all cultures and time periods. Since the Museum opened its doors to the public in its current location in Central Park in 1880, its footprint has expanded to cover more than two million square feet. Today, art comes alive in the Museum's galleries and through its exhibitions and events, revealing both new ideas and unexpected connections across time and cultures.</p>
